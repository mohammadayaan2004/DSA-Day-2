#DSA_Day-2<br/>
ðŸš€ Day 2 of 100 Days of DSA Challenge! ðŸ’»<br/>
Today, I dove deeper into fundamental programming concepts that are crucial for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms:<br/>
âœ… if-else statements <br/>
âœ… Loops<br/>
âœ… continue and break statements <br/>
âœ… switch statements <br/>
âœ… Pointers <br/>
âœ… Functions<br/>

These building blocks are essential for creating efficient and powerful algorithms. I'm excited to see how I'll apply these concepts in more complex problems as I progress through this challenge.<br/>
